    description: "The Lexus UX (Urban Explorer) was introduced as the brand's entry-level compact luxury crossover, positioned below the NX in size and price. Built on the Toyota New Global Architecture C (TNGA-C) platform shared with the Toyota C-HR and Corolla, it features a low center of gravity and rigid structure designed to deliver responsive handling. The UX was launched with two powertrain options: the UX 200 with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 169 horsepower paired with a Direct-Shift CVT, and the UX 250h hybrid combining a 2.0-liter engine with electric motors for a total system output of 181 horsepower. The hybrid model features an innovative E-Four all-wheel drive system with a dedicated electric motor powering the rear wheels. The exterior design showcases Lexus's contemporary styling with an aggressive interpretation of the spindle grille, angular LED headlights, and a distinctive full-width taillight design. The interior offers a driver-focused cockpit with premium materials and available features including a 10.3-inch display with Remote Touch Interface, head-up display, and heated/ventilated seats. Advanced safety comes standard through Lexus Safety System+ 2.0 including pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, dynamic radar cruise control, and lane tracing assist. In 2020, the UX 300e became Lexus's first all-electric vehicle in select markets (not offered in North America), while a 2023 update introduced an improved infotainment system with touchscreen functionality replacing the Remote Touch controller. Throughout its production, the UX has targeted urban-dwelling luxury buyers seeking a premium compact crossover with distinctive styling, refined driving dynamics, and advanced technology in a city-friendly package."
