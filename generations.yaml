    description: "The Lexus UX (Urban Explorer) was introduced as the brand's entry-level compact luxury crossover, positioned below the NX in size and price. Built on the Toyota New Global Architecture C (TNGA-C) platform shared with the Toyota C-HR and Corolla, it features a low center of gravity and rigid structure designed to deliver responsive handling. The UX was launched with two powertrain options: the UX 200 with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 169 horsepower paired with a Direct-Shift CVT, and the UX 250h hybrid combining a 2.0-liter engine with electric motors for a total system output of 181 horsepower. The hybrid model features an innovative E-Four all-wheel drive system with a dedicated electric motor powering the rear wheels. The exterior design showcases Lexus's contemporary styling with an aggressive interpretation of the spindle grille, angular LED headlights, and a distinctive full-width taillight design. The interior offers a driver-focused cockpit with premium materials and available features including a 10.3-inch display with Remote Touch Interface, head-up display, and heated/ventilated seats. Advanced safety comes standard through Lexus Safety System+ 2.0 including pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, dynamic radar cruise control, and lane tracing assist."

    description: "The Lexus UX received a mid-cycle update for the 2023 model year, introducing significant technological improvements while maintaining the core TNGA-C platform and design language. The interior upgrade included wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, an improved 8 or 12.3-inch display screen with higher quality, and the removal of the controversial touchpad controller in favor of a more intuitive interface. A digital key system was added, enabling smartphone-based vehicle access, along with a larger wireless cell phone charging pad and enhanced ambient lighting. Lexus Safety System+ was upgraded to version 2.5 with improved driver assistance features. The UX 300e electric variant continued to be offered in select markets, while the hybrid models remained the primary focus for most global markets including North America where the UX was exclusively hybrid for 2023. The exterior received subtle styling refinements including updated wheel designs and new color options, while maintaining the distinctive spindle grille and full-width taillight signature."

    description: "The Lexus UX continued with the same TNGA-C platform but received a significant powertrain update with the introduction of the UX 300h for the 2025 model year. The new hybrid system features a revised 2.0-liter M20A-FXS engine paired with an enhanced hybrid powertrain delivering 196 horsepower in front-wheel drive configuration, representing a notable increase from the previous UX 250h's output. The all-wheel-drive variant adds a more powerful rear electric motor generating 41 horsepower, improving overall system performance and efficiency. The hybrid battery system was updated to a higher capacity 222-volt lithium-ion unit, replacing the previous nickel-metal hydride battery. The interior continues to feature the upgraded touchscreen infotainment system introduced in the 2023 facelift, with seamless smartphone integration and improved voice controls. Exterior styling remains consistent with the 2023 refresh, while the UX maintains its position as Lexus's compact entry-level crossover, competing with models like the BMW X1, Mercedes-Benz GLA, and Audi Q3 in the premium subcompact SUV segment."
